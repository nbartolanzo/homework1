		<p>It is with great interest that I am applying for the <b>Entry Level Tax Accountant</b> position at Untracht Early LLC, New York. I learned of this opportunity by looking through Indeed.com. Currently I am a senior pursuing my Bachelors in Business Administration with a concentration in Accounting. As a hard worker and someone who enjoys pushing myself to reach my full potential, I can contribute greatly in your work environment. My education and my experiences outside the classroom have positioned me as a perfect candidate for this position.</p> 

		<p>I am interested in the Entry Level Tax Accountant position because of the opportunity to prepare tax returns, interact and communicate with clients and conducting necessary research. As an intern at <strong>Gentile Pismeny & Brengel, LLP,</strong> I work independently and with a group of interns in completing projects presented by the accounting staff. These projects include organizing files, journalizing transactions, and reconciling bank accounts. This allows me to utilize my knowledge of accounting and finance and to apply my analytical and quantitative skills. I effectively communicate with the CPA accountants in relation to addressing reporting errors that were made. While working closely with the tax managers, I interact with clients and provide assistance with preparing returns. I provide leadership and training to the new interns by answering any questions that they may present and helping them through projects that may pose as an obstacle, such as creating a new Quickbooks file for a client. Programs that are used in the internship include Microsoft Office suite (Word, Excel, and outlook) and QuickBooks.</p>
